problem file is /StGermain/Utils/Src/RegularMeshUtils.h I think. I think that StGermain/Discretisation/Utils/Utils.h:46, is not able to find RegularMeshUtils.h. Some kind of include error?

here is where the error function is:
./Snac/plugins/remesher_BI/RemeshElements.c:69: void createBarycenterGrids( void* _context );
./Snac/plugins/remesher_BI/RemeshElements.c:98: createBarycenterGrids( context );
./Snac/plugins/remesher_BI/RemeshElements.c:319:void createBarycenterGrids( void* _context )
